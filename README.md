# chadGPT

Chrome extension that adds helpful details to your prompt when interacting with chatGpt to increase quality of results. Benfit of doing prompt engineering  or fine tuning in browser is that we can piggyback on the user's session (+ only usage cost then becomes creating embeddings if fine tuning). 


### How to use
 - clone the repo
 - go to `chrome://extensions`
 - click on `enable developer mode`
 - click on `load unpacked` and upload saved repo
 - go to `https://chat.openai.com/chat`, ask it a question as you would normally
 - instead of clicking submit or pressing enter, press `cmd+enter` on macos and `ctrl+enter` on Windows
 - chadGpt will add helpful addtions to your prompt automatically


# TODO:
Goal is to elimiate the need for prompt engineering (given what ik rn it seems feasible but am fairly new to this)

- nice ui for fine tuning
- fine tune with given links
- write uni essays without plagiarism using citations. (https://openai.com/blog/webgpt/#samples)
